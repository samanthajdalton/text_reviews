# text_reviews

The user may need to pip install several packages to run the ipynb.  All the analysis is the jupyter analysis.ipnyb notebook.

The DataProcessing.py file contains support funtions to read in the text file, and make a dictionary of the reviews that is later put into a pandas dataframe.

HelperFunctions.py file contains the function for the word cloud.

There will be a TopicAnalysis.py file that will contain functions supporting topic analysis, but the import for this file is currently not working.
